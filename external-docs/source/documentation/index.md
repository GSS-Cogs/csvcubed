# Something

There's something here.

## W3C

There are many situations where it would be useful to be able to publish multi-dimensional data, such as statistics, on the web in such a way that it can be linked to related data sets and concepts. The Data Cube vocabulary provides a means to do this using the W3C RDF (Resource Description Framework) standard.

## SDMX

The model underpinning the Data Cube vocabulary is compatible with the cube model that underlies SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange), an ISO standard for exchanging and sharing statistical data and metadata among organizations.

## LINKED DATA

Linked data is an approach to publishing data on the web, enabling datasets to be linked together through references to common concepts.

## RDF vocabularies

The Data Cube vocabulary is focused purely on the publication of multi-dimensional data on the web.  

1.SKOS for concept schemes  
2.SCOVO for core statistical structures  
3.Dublin Core Terms for metadata  
4.VoiD for data access  
5.FOAF for agents  
6.ORG for organizations  

## Benefits of using RDF and Linked Data approach

The individual observations, and groups of observations, become (web) addressable. This allows publishers and third parties to annotate and link to this data. Data can be flexibly combined across datasets sets (for example find all Religious schools in census areas with high values for National Indicators pertaining to religious tolerance). The statistical data becomes an integral part of the broader web of linked data. For publishers who currently only offer static files then publishing as linked-data offers a flexible, non-proprietary, machine-readable means of publication that supports an out-of-the-box web API for programmatic access. It enables reuse of standardized tools and components.
