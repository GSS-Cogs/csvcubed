# Command Line

## inspect command
The inspect command is used to inspect the metadata of an existing Qube.

**Syntax**  
`csvcubed inspect [OPTIONS] TIDY_CSV_PATH`

**Arguments**

| Argument      | Description                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TIDY_CSV_PATH | The file path to the Qube data file, formatted as tidy data csv. |

**Options**

| Option      | Description                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| --help / -h | Show the command help text.                                                                                      |
| --log-level | Set the desired logging level to one of 'crit', 'err', 'warn', 'info' and 'debug'.  <br/> The default is 'warn'. |

**Log output**  
The logs are written to both the console and a log file. The verbosity of the logging is controlled by the `--log-level` option. 

The log messages can be used to help identify and resolve issues that are experienced when inspecting a Qube.

The log path depends on the operating system, and the following are typical paths:

> Below paths may also be influenced by your system configuration.

| Operating System | Typical Log Path                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**      | C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\csvcubed\csvcubed-cli\Logs\out.log |
| **Linux**        | /home/[UserName]/.cache/csvcubed/csvcubed-cli/Logs/out.log           |
| **MAC**          | /home/[UserName]/Library/Logs/csvcubed/csvcubed-cli/Logs/out.log     |

**Log Retention**  
A new log file is created daily, with backups being saved for 7 days in the same location. Older logs are overwritten in a cyclic manner with the oldest being replaced first.

## Input File Types

The inspect command takes a CSV data inputs that are provided in one of two specialised form of tidy data: [canonical approach](./../guides/shape-data.md#canonical-shape) and [pivoted approach](./../guides/shape-data.md#pivoted-shape). More specifically, the command takes following Qube types:

* Data cube with a single unit and single measure 
* Data cube with a single unit and multiple measures
* Data cube with multiple units and a single measure
* Data cube with multiple units and multiple measures
* Code list

        - Identifier: Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics: 1990 to 2020
        - Comment: Final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions.
        - Description: This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
                emissions going back to 1990. Estimates are presented by source in February of
                each year. They are updated in March of each year to include estimates by end-
                user, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification
                (SIC).

                These statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
                emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
                emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
                emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
                activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
                process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
                allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
                applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
                this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

                BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
                consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
                publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
                footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
                annually.

                For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
                small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
                sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
                residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
                forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

                These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
                which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
                reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
                Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year.

        - Description: This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
                emissions going back to 1990.

                Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated
                each year:

                  * in March, to include estimates by end-user and fuel type
                  * in June, to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

                The statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
                emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
                emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
                emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
                activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
                process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
                allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
                applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
                this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

                BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
                consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
                publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
                footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
                annually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions
                report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-
                emissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.

                For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
                small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
                sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
                residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
                forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

                These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
                which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
                Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
                reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
                Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A
                [list of corresponding Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) used and a record of
                base year emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-
                gas-emissions-explanatory-notes) are published separately.

                Duty](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cider-duty).

                The Alcohol Bulletin is updated quarterly and includes statistics on duty
                receipts up to the latest full month before its release, and statistics
                relating to clearances and production that are one month behind that of duty
                receipts.
