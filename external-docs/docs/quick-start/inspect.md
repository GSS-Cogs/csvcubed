# Inspecting a CSV-W

This page is designed to help you inspect an existing CSV-W. It assumes that you have already [installed csvcubed](./installation.md), [designed your CSV input](./designing-csv.md) and [built your CSV-W](./build.md).

To inspect the `sweden-at-eurovision-no-missing.csv-metadata.json` data cube we built in [Building a CSV-W](build.md), we run the [csvcubed inspect](../guides/command-line/inspect-command.md) command:

```bash
csvcubed inspect sweden-at-eurovision-no-missing.csv-metadata.json
```

All being well we get the below output. A detailed explanation of this output is provided in [csvcubed inspect](../guides/command-line/inspect-command.md#output-format) section.

Now we inspect the `language.csv-metadata.json` code list we built in [Building a CSV-W](build.md):

```bash
csvcubed inspect language.csv-metadata.json
```

All being well we get the below output. A detailed explanation of this output is provided in [csvcubed inspect](../guides/command-line/inspect-command.md#output-format) section.

## Errors

There are a number of errors that can occur when inspecting a CSV-W; most of them are designed to help ensure you get correct and valid outputs.

Please see our documentation explaining a [number of common errors](../guides/errors/index.md) to see what you can do to diagnose and correct any errors which occur.

## Next

This is the end of the quick start section, however there is a lot more information available in the guides section; see the left-hand menu.

The next logic action to take with the Sweden at Eurovision data set is to learn how to [describe missing data](../guides/missing-observed-values.md) so we can include contestants who weren't able to perform.
