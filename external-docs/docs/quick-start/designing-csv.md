# Designing a CSV

csvcubed needs to understand how your statistical data is structured in order to make it more machine readable. There are two ways that you can do this with csvcubed:

* Using the [convention-first approach](../guides/qube-config.md#convention-first-method) - you start out with a [standard CSV data shape](../guides/shape-data.md#standard-shape) with conventional column titles and fill it out with your data.
* Using the [configuration approach](../guides/qube-config.md#configuration) - you write a JSON configuration file which tells csvcubed exactly how to interpret your data.

This quick start will use the [convention-first approach](../guides/qube-config.md#convention-first-method) to help you generate a CSV-W cube. We assume that you already have a working [installation of csvcubed](./installation.md).

## Structuring your data

The [standard shape](../guides/shape-data.md#standard-shape) of data is the recommended way to shape your data for csvcubed. It requires that your CSV has the following columns:

| ...Identifying characteristics... | Value | Measure | Unit |
|:---------------------------------:|------:|--------:|-----:|
|                ...                |   3.4 |  Length | Feet |
|                ...                |   3.6 |  Length | Feet |

In the above table:

* *identifying characteristics* are one or more columns which identify the sub-set of the population has been observed in a given row. This are called [dimensions](../glossary/index.md#dimensionhttpswwww3orgtrvocab-data-cubecubes-model) elsewhere in documentation.
* the `Value` column contains the value which has been observed or measured; there is only ever one observed value per row in the [standard shape](../guides/shape-data.md#standard-shape).
* the `Measure` column describes what has been observed or measured; note that the measure should not include any information about the units of measure.
* the `Unit` column describes the unit of measure in which the `Value` has been recorded.

The names of the columns is how csvcubed interprets what each column contains in the [convention-first approach](../guides/qube-config.md#convention-first-method). Using the column titles `Value`, `Measure` and `Unit` or one of their [synonyms](../guides/qube-config.md#conventional-column-names) in your CSV will work. All other columns are assumed to be *identifying characteristics* ([dimensions](../glossary/index.md#dimensionhttpswwww3orgtrvocab-data-cubecubes-model)).

## Adding your data

First, we start by taking the above shape and adding columns for each of your *identifying characteristics* ([dimensions](../glossary/index.md#dimensionhttpswwww3orgtrvocab-data-cubecubes-model)).

From hereonin we will be creating a data set to represent the competition winners in Eurovision. Our CSV will be structured as per the following extract:

| Year | Entrant            | Song     | Language | Value |         Measure |    Unit |
|:----:|:-------------------|:---------|:---------|------:|----------------:|--------:|
| 1974 | ABBA               | Waterloo | English  |     1 |      Final Rank | Ordinal |
| 1974 | ABBA               | Waterloo | English  |    24 |    Final Points |  Points |
| 1974 | ABBA               | Waterloo | English  |     6 | People on Stage |  People |
| 2008 | Charlotte Perrelli | Hero     | English  |     5 | People on Stage |  People |
| 2008 | Charlotte Perrelli | Hero     | English  |    18 |      Final Rank | Ordinal |
| 2008 | Charlotte Perrelli | Hero     | English  |    47 |    Final Points |  Points |

```csv
Year,Entrant,Song,Language,Value,Measure,Unit
1974,ABBA,Waterloo,English,1,Final Rank,Ordinal
1974,ABBA,Waterloo,English,24,Final Points,Points
1974,ABBA,Waterloo,English,6,People on Stage,People
2008,Charlotte Perrelli,Hero,English,5,People on Stage,People
2008,Charlotte Perrelli,Hero,English,18,Final Rank,Ordinal
2008,Charlotte Perrelli,Hero,English,47,Final Points,Points
```

Where `Year`, `Entrant`, `Song` and `Language` are the cube's identifying [dimensions](../glossary/index.md#dimensionhttpswwww3orgtrvocab-data-cubecubes-model).

Note that we have included multiple measures in this dataset as `Final Rank`, `Final Points` and `People on Stage` have been recorded for each contestant.

You can download the full CSV [here](TODO).

The next step is to [build a CSV-W](./build.md).
