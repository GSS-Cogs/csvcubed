# Installation

[csvcubed](https://pypi.org/project/csvcubed/) is on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), Python's main package repository. It requires Python version 3.9 or 3.10, and we have kept its other dependencies as low as we reasonably can. Installation can be done with your favoured python package manager like pip.

```bash
pip install csvcubed csvcubed-models
```

That's it, let the installation happen.

There are two sub commands of interest:

* [csvcubed build](./build-command.md) - build a CSV-W cube from a CSV file
* [csvcubed inspect](./inspect-command.md) - inspect a CSV-W generated by csvcubed to see what it contains
