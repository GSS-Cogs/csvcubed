# Installation

## Installing python environment

csvcubed supports the following python versions:

* 3.9
* 3.10

We recommend using [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your python environments.

### miniconda installation

To install miniconda, go to [this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

Once you have installed miniconda, you will need to configure an environment specifically for csvcubed.

```bash
# create a new environment using python 3.10
conda create -n csvcubed python='3.10' -y
```

If you are using miniconda, you must be inside your `csvcubed` environment before running any commands:

```bash
# enter the csvcubed python 3.10 environment
conda activate csvcubed 
```

### Manual installation (advanced)

[Download and install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) your chosen version of python.

## Installing csvcubed

[csvcubed](https://pypi.org/project/csvcubed/) is on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), Python's main package repository. Installation can be done with your favoured python package manager like [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install csvcubed csvcubed-models
```

That's it, let the installation happen.

There are two sub-commands:

* [csvcubed build](../guides/command-line/build-command.md) - build a CSV-W cube from a CSV file
* [csvcubed inspect](../guides/command-line/inspect-command.md) - inspect a CSV-W generated by csvcubed to see what it contains

## Next

The next step is to [design your CSV](./designing-csv.md).
