## Prerequisites

csvcubed requires a modern version of python, for those who do not have a python environment or package manager, please see the [installing python guide](../guides/installing-python.md) before proceeding.

## Installing csvcubed

[csvcubed](https://pypi.org/project/csvcubed/) is on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), Python's main package repository. Installation can be done with your favoured python package manager like [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

*run this command in your terminal*

```bash
pip install csvcubed
```

That's it, let the installation happen.

There are two sub-commands:

* [csvcubed build](../guides/command-line/build-command.md) - build a CSV-W cube from a CSV file
* [csvcubed inspect](../guides/command-line/inspect-command.md) - inspect a CSV-W generated by csvcubed to see what it contains

## Next

The next step is to [design your CSV](./designing-csv.md).
