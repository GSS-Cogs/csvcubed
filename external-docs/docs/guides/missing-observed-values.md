# Handling missing observed values

It is sometimes the case that you cannot provide a value for a given [observation](../glossary/index.md#observation-observed-value) but you would still like to include the observation in the dataset to communicate why the value is missing. This could be for a number of reasons such as invalid or failed measurements, suppression to avoid disclosing sensitive data, or because circumstances wouldn't permit an observation.

csvcubed permits missing observation values as long as there is an _attribute_ column which explains why the value is missing. The _attribute_ column must be based on the `http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/attribute#obsStatus` attribute. The observation which is missing must have the observation status filled in.

Blank values are represented as a zero length string in an observation column in csv format (i.e. `,,`).

## A worked example: Sweden in Eurovision

In the example below, which is an extract of a data set capturing Sweden's Eurovision entries, we see a Marker column which is used to explain why a the given row's observed value is missing.

For example:

* the number of People on the stage is known for Anna Bergendahl's entry into Eurovision as she comepted in second semi-final; however as she didn't make it to the final, her Final Points, and Final Rank are not applicable and therefore the observations are blank in the associated csv. 
* in the case of The Mama's entry in 2020, the entire contest was cancelled so no values are provided however they were to represent Sweden at Eurovision that year.

It is important to note that the `Marker` column is based on the existing `http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx/2009/attribute#obsStatus` attribute; this is vital to ensure that csvcubed knows that the attribute describes the status of the observation. An observation status column can also be used to note where an observation is provisional, revised, suppressed, final, etc.

## Configuration of observation status in `qube-config.json`

Adding a `Marker` column to represent the observation status can be done in the column definitions section of the [qube-config](./configuration/index.md) file. In this example the Marker column has the following configuration:

```json
        "Marker": {
            "from_template": "observation-status"
        },
```
