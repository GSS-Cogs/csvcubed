# Error - observed values missing

## When it occurs

There are missing (blank) observed values present in the data CSV. These values do not have an observation status to explain why the value is missing.  

## How to fix

All rows in your data CSV must have an observed value unless the observation has an *observation status* attribute explaining why the value is missing. See the guide on [handling missing observed values](../missing-observed-values.md) for more information.
