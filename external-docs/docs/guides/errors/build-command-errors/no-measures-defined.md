# Error - no measures defined

## When it occurs

The population characteristic being measured has not been defined in the cube.

## How to fix

Ensure that your have correctly defined the measures present in your cube. It is possible to define measures in two ways:

* **against the observed value column definition**, when all values in the cube measure the same population characteristic.
* **as a measures column**, where the cube contains observed values measuring different population characteristics.
