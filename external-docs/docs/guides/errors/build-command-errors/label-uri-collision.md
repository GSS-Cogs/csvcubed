# Error - Label URI Collision

## When it occurs

_When the URI-Safe value derived from more than one column title or value results in the same URI-Safe column label_.  

## How to fix

Identify which titles or values have resulted in the duplicate URI-Safe equivalents and modify to avoid the collision.
The [Working with URIs Guide](../../uris.md) covers how URI-Safe equivalent values are derived.
