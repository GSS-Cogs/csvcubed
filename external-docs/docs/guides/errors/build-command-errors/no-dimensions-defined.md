# Error - no dimensions defined

## When it occurs

When a cube does not have any dimensions.

## How to fix

Add a dimension to your data CSV and a column mapping to the JSON configuration file declaring that it is a dimension. All cubes must contain at least one dimension as they identify which subset of the statistical population an observation refers to.
