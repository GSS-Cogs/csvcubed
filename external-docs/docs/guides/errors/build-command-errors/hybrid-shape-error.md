# Error - Hybrid shape error

## When it occurs

There are mutliple observation value columns defined without measures linked and at least one measure column defined. This is an erroneous hybrid between standard and pivoted shape. 

## How to fix

The dataset must adhere to one of the accepted shapes of data (standard or pivoted).
