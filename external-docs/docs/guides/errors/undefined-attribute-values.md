# Error - undefined attribiute values

## When it occurs

Some of the attribute values referenced by the column's data values are not defined.

This error only arises where new attribute values are defined in the attribute column's JSON mapping. Existing attribute values are not currently validated by csvcubed.

## How to fix

Ensure that new attribute values are defined for all of the values in your attribute column.
