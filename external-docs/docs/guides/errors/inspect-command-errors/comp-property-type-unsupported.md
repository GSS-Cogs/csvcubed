# Error - DSD component property type `<property_type>` is not supported

## When it occurs

The supported data structure definition (DSD) property types are `Dimension`,  `Attribute` and `Measure`.

## How to fix

Make sure the input CSV-W JSON-LD is a valid data cube or a code list that is provided in one of two specialised forms of tidy data: [standard shape](../../shape-data/standard-shape.md) and [pivoted shape](../../shape-data/pivoted-shape.md).
