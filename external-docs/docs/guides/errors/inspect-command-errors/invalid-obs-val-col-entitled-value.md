# Error - Invalid observation value column entitled "Value"

## When it occurs

In a pivoted shape cube, observation value columns may not be entitled "Value".

## How to fix

If your data set is in the pivoted shape, rename the observation value column(s) to something other than "Value". See the [pivoted shape](../../shape-data/pivoted-shape.md) documentation for more details.
