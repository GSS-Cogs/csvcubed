# Error - Expected `x` record(s), but found `y` record(s). 

## When it occurs

The inspect command did not find the expected number of records in the data set.

## How to fix

Make sure the input CSV-W json-ld is a valid data cube or a code list that is provided in one of two specialised forms of tidy data: [standard shape](../../../guides/shape-data.md#standard-shape) and [pivoted shape](../../../guides/shape-data.md#pivoted-shape).
