# Error - undefined units

## When it occurs

Some of the units referenced by a units column's values are not defined.

This error only arises where new units are defined in the units column's JSON mapping. Existing units are not currently validated by csvcubed.

## How to fix

Ensure that all of the values in your units column have units which defined in the column mapping.
