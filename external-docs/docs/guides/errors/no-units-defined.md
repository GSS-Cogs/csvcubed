# Error - no units defined

## When it occurs

The unit of measure has not been defined in the cube.

## How to fix

Ensure that your have correctly defined the units present in your cube. It is possible to define units in two ways:

* **against the observed value column definition**, when all values in the cube are measured in the same unit.
* **as a units column**, where the cube contains observed values measured in different units.
