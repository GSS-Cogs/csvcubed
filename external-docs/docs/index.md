## The Project
### What the Project is about

The csvcubed project aims to provide libraries and utilities which make it simple to turn a CSV into [5* linked data](https://5stardata.info/en/). We want to make it easier for data producers to annotate their existing data with the metadata required to ensure that each dataset is discoverable, comparable and analysable by automated tools.

The csvcubed catalogue of tools help to deliver this vision in an opinionated fashion. Our tools output [data cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cube) using the [CSV on the web (CSV-W)](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/) file format. Within these CSV-W files we describe what the data represents using a combination of the following ontologies:

- [RDF Data Cube (qb)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/)
- [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer)
- [Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT2)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/)
