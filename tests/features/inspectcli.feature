                    Estimates are presented by source in February of each year. They are updated
                    each year:

                    * in March, to include estimates by end-user and fuel type
                    * in June, to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

                    The statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
                    emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
                    emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
                    emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
                    activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
                    process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
                    allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
                    applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
                    this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

                    BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
                    consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
                    publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
                    footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
                    annually. The [alternative approaches to reporting UK greenhouse gas emissions
                    report](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-greenhouse-gas-
                    emissions-explanatory-notes) outlines the differences between them.

                    For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
                    small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
                    sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
                    residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
                    forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

                    These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
                    which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
                    Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
                    reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
                    Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year. A

            - Comment: Final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas emissions.
            - Description: This publication provides the final estimates of UK territorial greenhouse gas
                    emissions going back to 1990. Estimates are presented by source in February of
                    each year. They are updated in March of each year to include estimates by end-
                    user, and in June to include estimates by Standard Industrial Classification
                    (SIC).

                    These statistics covers emissions that occur within the UK’s borders. When
                    emissions are reported by source, emissions are attributed to the sector that
                    emits them directly. When emissions are reported by end-user, energy supply
                    emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use
                    activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling
                    process. For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is
                    allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when
                    applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of
                    this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial users.

                    BEIS does not estimate emissions outside the UK associated with UK
                    consumption, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
                    publishes estimates of the [UK’s carbon
                    footprint](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint)
                    annually.

                    For the purposes of reporting, greenhouse gas emissions are allocated into a
                    small number of broad, high level sectors known as National Communication
                    sectors, which are as follows: energy supply, business, transport, public,
                    residential, agriculture, industrial processes, land use land use change and
                    forestry (LULUCF), and waste management.

                    These high-level sectors are made up of a number of more detailed sectors,
                    which follow the definitions set out by the [International Panel on Climate
                    Change (IPCC)](http://www.ipcc.ch/), and which are used in international
                    reporting tables which are submitted to the [United Nations Framework
                    Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)](https://unfccc.int/) every year.

            - Description: ### UK total energy production and consumption (PDF)

                    An overview of the trends in energy production and consumption in the United
                    Kingdom for the previous quarter, focusing on:​

                    * production ​
                    * consumption, both primary and final by broad sector, including seasonally adjusted series​
                    * dependency rates of imports, fossil fuels and low carbon fuels​

                    We publish this document on the last Thursday of each calendar quarter (March,
                    June, September and December).

                    ### Quarterly data (all tables)​

                    The quarterly version of the tables covers production, consumption by broad
                    sector and key energy dependency ratios.

                    We publish all tables (ET 1.1 - ET 1.3) on a quarterly basis, on the last
                    Thursday of the calendar quarter (March, June, September and December). The
                    data is a quarter in arrears.​

                    ### Monthly data​ ET 1.1, ET 1.2

                    The monthly versions focus on production and consumption only. More detail is
                    provided in the quarterly versions.

                    We publish 2 of the tables on a monthly basis (ET 1.1 and ET 1.2), on the last
                    Thursday of the month.

                    ### Earlier data​
