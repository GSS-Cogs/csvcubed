# Note

The reason for this folder to exists is becasue we cannot keep the `templates` folder inside src/csvcubed/. This is since the PURL referenced by existing versions of csvcubed out in the wild will break if we change the location of the `templates` folder. So we will be keeping the `templates` here.
