# csvwlib

A refactored version of the functionality required to build *CSV-qb*s along with the functionality necessary to convert said *CSV-qb*s into RDF compatible with the PMD platform.

## Packages

| Name                                                  | Description                                                                         |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [csvqb](./csvqb/csvqb/README.md)                      | The key library helping to transform tidy-data into qb-flavoured CSV-W cubes.       |
| [sharedmodels](./sharedmodels/sharedmodels/README.md) | Models and RDF serialisation functionality required by the csvqb and pmd packages.  |
| [pmd](./pmd/pmd/README.md)                            | Transforms a CSV-qb into RDF which is compatible with the Publish My Data platform. |
| [devtools](./devtools/devtools/README.md)             | Shared test functionality & dev dependencies which are commonly required.           |

We're currently keeping all of the packages in one repository to make life easier whilst we break apart and refactor the existing code we have in [GSS-utils](https://github.com/GSS-Cogs/gss-utils). Once we're confident in how our packages look (and they're stable), it's likely that each individual package will be moved to its own independent repository.
